# Shotgunner
Ballistic calculator for shotguns
This Qt application performs ballistic calculations for shotgun pellets in flight, 
providing velocity, energy, drop, crosswind drift and time of flight. This allows
maximum range estimates and tatget leads.
The user can vary a number of parameters relevant to the calculations.

The home web page for this project is: http://ctmuzzleloaders.com/ctml_experiments/shot-ballistics/shot-ballistics.html

This web page also has the code and application as a Dart project.
